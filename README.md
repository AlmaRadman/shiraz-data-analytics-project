shiraz data analitic project
Summary:
This project focuses on assessing the quality of high-traffic streets in Shiraz. The aim is to identify the current condition of streets based on various physical, functional, social, and cultural indicators. Data were collected manually from field observations and image analysis, and each street segment was scored for all indicators. After the initial data collection, random data were generated to increase dataset size and enhance the reliability and robustness of the project.

Main steps of the project:

Data collection and preparation: Gathering data from images and field observations, assigning scores to each street segment.

Random data generation: Increasing dataset size for more accurate and robust analysis.

Averaging segments: Calculating the average score of each street for every indicator.

Descriptive statistics: Computing the mean and median of each indicator to examine overall street conditions.

Inferential statistics: Using Bootstrap to compute 95% confidence intervals for the mean of each indicator, without requiring data normality.

Status categorization: Indicators were classified into three categories: “Good”, “Average”, and “Poor”.

Visualization: Creating bar charts to display the status of each indicator and identify strengths and weaknesses.

The results indicate that some indicators like “Planting Plan” and “Spatial Legibility” are in good condition, while indicators such as “Urban Elements” and “Urban Furniture” require improvement.

Skills: Excel, Python (pandas, numpy), Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), Git/GitHub, Data Analysis
